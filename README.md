## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Inspired by the captivating design and smooth animations of [Zentry](https://zentry.com/), this project is my personal take on recreating its essence. I focused heavily on harnessing the power of GSAP for sophisticated animations, crafting a seamless and engaging user experience. This project showcases my skills in TypeScript, React, and responsive design, resulting in a visually stunning and interactive website.

## <a name="tech-stack"> 🛠️ Tech Stack</a>

- **React (with TypeScript):** For building the dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** The heart of the animation magic, powering smooth transitions and effects.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid styling and responsive design.

## <a name="features"> ✨ Features</a>

- **Dynamic Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Just like Zentry, elements come to life as you scroll, creating a captivating narrative. (Include specific examples: e.g., parallax effects, fade-in animations, morphing shapes)
- **Interactive Elements:** Engaging hover effects and click interactions enhance user immersion. (Provide examples: 3D transforms, color transitions, micro-interactions)
- **Audio-Visual Integration:** Seamlessly integrated audio and video elements enhance the storytelling and create a richer experience. (Describe how audio/video is used)
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a consistent experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Clean Code and Component Structure:** Well-organized codebase for maintainability and scalability.

## <a name="getting-started"> 🏃 Getting Started</a>
